# JUDGEMENT

<p id="quote">“It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Henry David Thoreau</p>   

Judgement is a tool that we use to quickly assign value to what may be beneficial or harmful to us. Our minds judge because it breaks the world down into more digestible elements, enabling us to act and make decisions more quickly. However, our judgements, especially in relation to others and ourselves, limit our worldview and thus reduce our capacity for understanding and compassion.

If we assume someone isn’t intelligent because they don’t speak, think, or act like us, our mind labels this person as “unintelligent”. Anything they say passes through our veil of judgement. In conversation, their words are overshadowed by our mind’s labels. <b>We aren’t interacting with <i>them</i> - we’re interacting with our judgements of them!</b>

Nothing in the world has any objective worth, and therefore, no judgement is true. Nothing is good or bad, nothing is easy or difficult; it is only the projections of our mind that make it so. As a result, judging less puts us in touch with reality, free of our mind’s biases. Walking the path of non-judgement is a key part of living a more enlightened life and beginning deeper self-discovery. 

Additionally, what we judge others for is often what we criticize ourselves for. Therefore, whenever we (inevitably) find ourselves judging another person, we have a doorway to see what our own insecurities may be. <b>Becoming aware of our judgements is synonymous with becoming aware of ourselves.</b>

When attempting to reduce our judgement, it’s important to remember to not bring ourselves down for being judgemental. Having insecurities and passing judgement is a part of the human condition - be patient with yourself!

Our negative judgements surface as a way to cope with our insecurities. In our next edition, we’ll talk about insecurities and how to address them.

Enjoy your week!
