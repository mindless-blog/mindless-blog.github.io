# ENLIGHTENMENT

The idea of enlightenment has been around for centuries, and is depicted in a variety of ways among different cultures and groups around the world. Today, we will talk about how enlightenment is closely connected with the present moment, and explore its implications in daily life.

First, let’s clarify what enlightenment is not. It is not an emotion, thought, or skill that you have. Enlightenment is a state of being that occurs naturally when an individual has ***completely*** accepted ***what is***.

Practically speaking, this means such a person no longer resists conflicts, social situations, or life events; they have completely accepted them. This state of total non-resistance exists only in the present moment- when you wish you were elsewhere (resistance manifesting as thoughts), your attention is drawn away from the Now. In short, enlightenment occurs when your focus remains in the present, even in the face of provoking challenges.

Paradoxically, enlightenment isn’t something you can “reach” or “achieve”. It would be more accurate to say that enlightenment is a process that happens to you. If you desire to become enlightened, you are still acting upon a perceived inadequacy; you are still wishing you were *there*. But enlightenment is about being here; the truth is that you are enough ***now***.

In some Eastern cultures, enlightened people are referred to as “fully realized beings”. This is because **enlightenment is the default state of all humans**, but the hyperactivity of the thinking mind prevents the majority of us from seeing that. The ego overlays chatter during most moments of silence. As our mindfulness practice grows, we experience more presence and our need for thoughts diminishes.

A common misconception about enlightenment is that it is some kind of superpower that you have. In actuality, being enlightened changes nothing about your life circumstances. It simply alters your *perception* of them.

Without the judgement and chatter of the mind, you find beauty, complexity, and presence in ***every*** moment of life, not just the ones your mind chooses to approve of (you become “mindless”). This is why enlightenment is also sometimes referred to as “liberation”- you are free from yourself.

Our goal should not be to “reach” enlightenment, but rather to cultivate peace, presence, and awareness in our daily lives. Enlightened or not, these principles will guide your mindfulness journey.

**Be here now.**
