# FRUSTRATION

<p id="quote">“Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Lao Tzu</p>    

Often times, something a friend says leaves us annoyed, frustrated, or even angry. Someone might cancel plans, say something rude, or just not *get* us. **A lot of people’s behaviors inevitably rub us the wrong way, resulting in frustration & judgement.**

Other people aren’t perfect and neither are we - it’s alright for their behaviors and for our reactions to be imperfect.

When you find a feeling of frustration or anger arise, do as we have suggested before - just *notice* it. Do your best to not give it power or let it dictate your actions.

As you know, acting on your frustration will only create a cycle of negative thoughts and actions for you and the other person.

Instead, think of *why* the person might have done what they did. **Understand that the external negative behavior of others is a manifestation of their own inner state** - they are experiencing their own ups and downs & judgement serves no purpose.

We can’t control others’ actions, but **we can control how we respond**. And, if we develop the ability to refrain from acting on our judgements of others, we open the possibility of becoming compassionate towards them.

With enough practice, this compassion naturally extends in all directions: allowing us to love and appreciate anyone regardless of how we think or feel about them. We begin to love them for their **PRESENCE** rather than arbitrary judgements created by our mind.

Frustration is a part of being alive. To many, it is an obstacle to a peaceful life; but viewed from a different perspective, it can be a powerful tool to awaken our own enlightened nature: unconditional love in all directions.

**Relax today.**

See you next week!
