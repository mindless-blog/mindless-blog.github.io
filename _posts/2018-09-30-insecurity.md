# INSECURITY

<p id="quote">“I do have my insecurities, but I feel good in my skin, and my heart is full of love.”</p>

Our society and social circles expose us to people with remarkable talents, skills, and achievements. Unfortunately, we sometimes fall into the trap of measuring ourselves against them. As a result, we may begin to feel like we’re deficient- that we’re not attractive, smart, or successful <i>enough</i>. Insecurities like these make us feel separate from the rest of the world and corrode our self-confidence.

When we become insecure, we sometimes try to compensate through judgement or denial. If we’re scared we aren’t as intelligent as someone else, we tend to inflate our own intellect to make ourselves feel more comparable. Or, we might convince ourselves that they’re just “better” than us. We may even deny outright that our fear exists in the first place. In any case, we put ourselves through suffering because we’re afraid to accept our perceived shortcomings.

<b>Neglecting our insecurities does not make them go away, and neither does judging others or ourselves. The only way to heal our insecurities is to acknowledge, and be fully present to them.</b>

If you feel an urgency to cover up your insecurity, either by judgement or denial, do not. Simply acknowledge its presence, but do not act upon it. Remember that no action or achievement alone will solve it. Instead, distance your emotional state from the insecurity by sitting with the feeling rather than identifying with it. <b>You become less insecure each time you practice this technique.</b> You don’t need to “do” anything for this to work - <b>mindfulness itself catalyzes this transformation.</b>

Becoming present to the things that make us uncomfortable takes courage and persistence. It forces us to be deeply vulnerable with ourselves, and acknowledge our imperfections face-to-face. Even though our insecurities make us feel isolated, they are what make us human - everyone is insecure to some degree! Our goal is not to eradicate our insecurities, but to sit down with them, hear what they have to say, and let them go in peace. Mindfulness is the answer.

In the noise of everyday life, it’s difficult to be intentional about our well-being. Our next article will focus on self-care.

Look out for next week!
