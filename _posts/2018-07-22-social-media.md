# SOCIAL MEDIA

<p id="quote">“It is difficult to find happiness within oneself, but it is impossible to find it anywhere else.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Arthur Schopenhauer</p>



Social media can be a powerful tool to connect with those who are important to us. It enables us to share the things that matter, and stay updated on friends and family regardless of distance. However, it can be easy to become consumed by it, wrongly leading us to believe that an online profile encapsulates a person’s social existence and that others’ reactions to our profile is an accurate reflection of our worth. 

Social media can lead us to believe that our lives are inadequate. We might assume that a person doesn’t have bad days because their posts don’t show any. We might even assume that someone has the perfect body, job, or social situation... all just because of a few carefully selected photos!

It’s important to remember that a person’s social media presence is closer to a highlight reel than an all-inclusive summary. Therefore, we should try not to compare our entire lives, ups and downs included, to our limited perception of someone else’s.

Getting “likes” on what we post feels reassuring. Validation feels good, and there’s nothing wrong with that. But YOU DON’T NEED ANYONE’S VALIDATION. We should remind ourselves that the true source of affirmation and contentment comes from within - chasing likes and external approval will not provide long-term happiness. 

Sometime this week, we encourage you to reflect on your relationship with social media. For young people especially, it can be difficult to imagine a day without it. We encourage you to find out! Try and go a full day without opening Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat! 

However, be wary of eliminating social media as the ultimate solution. More important than <i>whether</i> you use social media is <i>how</i> you choose to use it. 

Take this opportunity to pause and be mindful of your thoughts as you reflect upon your social media habits! Ask yourself - what emotions arise when you think about your posting habits? How do you view others on social media? Do any comparisons happen? Maybe you can even begin to think about why you check newsfeeds in the first place!

Ultimately, a greater awareness of our relationship with social media can lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our relationship with social validation as a whole. This will be our topic for next week.


Until then,  
Ethan & Martin
