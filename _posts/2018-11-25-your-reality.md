# YOU ARE CREATING YOUR OWN REALITY

<p id="quote">“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs,
who comes short again and again, who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Theodore Roosevelt</p>    


No one experiences an objective reality. We are all in our own heads, and the reality we experience every day is our *perception* of life unfolding around us. The key here is that perception is a malleable skill: we can learn to perceive challenges as opportunities and hardship as growth.

Since our reality is determined by our perceptions, changing our perceptions directly changes the world we experience. Internalizing this lesson allows us to see that **our mind is in control of our reality. Life is not happening *to* us, it is happening *from* us.**

We cannot completely control our life circumstances. Sometimes, our bus is late, we aren’t able to finish our work, or the people around us are just jerks. These sorts of situations can aggravate us, and shake our connection to the present moment.

What is in our control is our *reaction* to our life circumstances. We may not be able to control *what* happens to us, but we can modify *how* we perceive & respond to it. Acknowledging that you are fundamentally responsible for your perceptions is scary and daunting, because it means we can no longer hide behind our blame and criticism of others when things go wrong. **It means owning up and being responsible for the life we live.**

**Realize that the only person stopping you from living the life you want is yourself. If others get in the way, become resourceful to find a solution.** But do not blame, judge, or criticize; these will only waste your energy and pollute your mind.

Mindfulness is not a passive exercise, as many people would assume. It empowers us to remove barriers to making changes in life by grounding our perceptions in the present moment. It allows us to see that the conditioning of our mind is the only thing preventing us from achieving our highest success.

**Mindfulness is not a magic pill or a fad diet; it is a transformation in our fundamental understanding of life itself.**

Until next week,
