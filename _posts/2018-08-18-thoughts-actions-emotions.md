# THOUGHTS, ACTIONS, AND EMOTIONS

<p id="quote">“What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our mind.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Buddha</p>   


Our thoughts, actions, and emotions work together to create our life experience, and an understanding of this cycle can empower us to reduce negative thinking and thus improve our lives. When we aren’t burdened by constant negative thoughts, being mindful can become effortless. The question shifts from “how do I <i>put</i> myself in the present moment?” to “<b>what am I thinking or doing that’s impeding me from being there naturally?</b>”

This framework can help us reflect on our mental habits. Let’s look at a fictional situation to better understand the cycle that connects thoughts/beliefs, emotions, and actions.

Jane Doe struggles with social anxiety. When she thinks about going to meet new friends, she worries (thinking) she isn’t impressive enough or that they won’t enjoy her. She feels (emotions) lonely and disconnected. She chooses (action) to remain alone.

Pretty soon, Jane hardly thinks about meeting anyone new. She has become so accustomed to the isolating thought pattern that it becomes subconscious. Jane has unknowingly adopted a belief that she isn’t good enough to earn the friendship of others. The downward cycle she’s in will continually lower her self-worth and make her increasingly detached. Unless she changes something!

If Jane wants to change, she needs to stop the momentum of the cycle she’s in. She can break the cycle by <b>acting the way she knows she would <i>like</i> to be, rather than the way she feels like acting</b>. Doing so begins a new cycle, with upward momentum - she will make new friends, and her emotions, thoughts, and beliefs about herself will improve naturally.

Acting differently changed one side of Jane’s cycle, but it’s important to note that revising <i>any</i> side of your triangle can change your life. <b>On the other hand, inaction will leave you and your life in the same state it has always been.</b>

## APPLICATION

We don’t feel insecure or anxious because we’re somehow inherently incompetent or for “no reason”, we do so because <b>we’ve become stuck in our mind’s mental habits</b>. Our self-judgements are unconsciously created by our mind when we don’t have an inner-awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and actions.

<b>The problem is not <i>us</i>. The problem is simply created by a lack of self-awareness.</b>

Increasing self-awareness enables us to make the changes we need. However, it’s important to remember our mind is not our enemy - we don’t need to fight it. Instead, we should calmly reevaluate our relationship with it when it doesn’t permit us to lead our best life.

We do so by redirecting its focus to growth through action & positive thinking - straining to become aware of why you do everything the way you do is not productive. <b>In the end, this framework is useful only when you want to change a significant behavior or belief about yourself. Don’t throw yourself into an existential crisis!</b>

Finally, doing inner-work doesn’t make us “better”. It simply moves us closer to fully understanding a timeless truth: <b>we are not bad and we don’t deserve to feel bad.</b>

Sharing what we’re struggling with close ones can fill our journey with compassion and profound connection. Our next edition will focus on the importance of Vulnerability.

Until next time,
