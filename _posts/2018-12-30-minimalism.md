# MINIMALISM

Minimalism is a practice that entails living only with the things you value most. Most commonly, it is a framework used to critically assess the value of what we own. We don’t need to be minimalists, but an understanding of this philosophy can empower us to gain a new perspective on our lifestyle and relationship with possessions.

Minimalists are known for living very modestly, and the name “minimalism” itself implies a need for very few possessions. **But, more important than what you own is *how* you choose to own it.** Minimalism actually has nothing to do with the *amount* of stuff you own, but instead concentrates on its *added value* in your daily life.

Is the sweatshirt that’s been sitting in your closet for years adding any value to your life? Will buying the new iPhone change anything about how you live? Is the assortment of souvenirs, trinkets, and old electronics gathering dust on your shelf ameliorating your lifestyle?

When reassessing possessions, it’s helpful to ask yourself the following questions - **Does this item make me happy? Do I use it frequently? Does it add unique value?** For example, while buying a third pair of running shoes might temporarily bring you joy, it will likely only be used a couple times a month and does not bring any long-term enjoyment or unique value.

A good step to begin decluttering is to remove any clothing or desk items you haven’t used in the past few months. Odds are, if you haven’t worn something in three months (weather permitting), you won’t wear it often, and you don’t *really* like it.

It’s always tough to get rid of things that belong to us, but living with less allows us to feel lighter. We no longer have the feeling of being weighed down by what we own.

**Minimalism eliminates clutter. Less clutter leads to more clarity.** When we begin practicing minimalism towards our physical possessions, it bleeds into our mental faculties as well. Do I need to worry about how this person thinks about me? **No**. Most of the time, the thought itself adds no value to your life. Let it go as you would an unused sweatshirt.

Minimalism moves us away from unnecessary attachments and towards living our lives with clarity & intention. If we are intentional about what we own, we are empowered to become intentional about the relationships we build, the direction of our career, and, of course, our mindfulness practice!

<i style="color: #777; display: block; text-align: center;">For our media this week, we highly recommend <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80114460">Minimalism</a>, available on Netflix. It's a great documentary about different people experimenting with minimalist and mindful lifestyles. It had a great impact on my exploration of mindfulness and I hope it helps you too!</i>
