# EMPATHY

<p id="quote">“When another person makes you suffer, it is because they suffer deeply within themselves and their suffering is spilling over. They do not need punishment, they need help.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Thich Nhat Hanh</p>   


Empathy is the most human way of understanding, connecting, and being with others. It is especially valuable when trying to connect with close ones who may be suffering. Empathy is powerful because it deepens our bonds with others, widens our perspective on life, and exposes us to our own vulnerable nature.

However, practicing empathy is not just a momentary thought of another person’s situation; it is a continuous, active process to understand, acknowledge, and feel what another person is going through.

Here are some simple steps towards empathy:  

* Ask clarifying questions to <i>fully</i> understand the situation and how the other person feels. Often this connection stems from an understanding of the person’s deeper emotional state.
* Mentally place yourself in their situation before giving any reply. “If I was in their situation and thought & felt as they do, what would help me?”
* Don’t rush to respond when they speak. Taking an extra moment to allow their words and feelings to soak in will enable more clarity in your response.
* Refrain from telling others they “should” feel differently than they do. You are not here to fix or correct their attitudes - <b>you are here to give the other person strength through your support.</b>
* Remember that feeling what another person is going through is beyond your own judgements about their situation. In order to connect, look beyond your mind’s labels.

If we aren’t intentionally empathetic, the majority of our life experiences lie within the boundaries of our perceptions. On the flip side, embracing empathy means <b>recognizing that another person’s reality is as true to them as ours is to us</b>. It is not just a tool to help another person heal; <b>it is a journey to blur the lines between “us” & “them”</b>.

Practicing empathy with close ones also increases our capacity for empathy with strangers. Instead of becoming annoyed or upset when another acts differently than we’d like, we can try to imagine what life circumstances have caused them to act the way they do. We may never know, but giving others the benefit of the doubt pacifies our mind to a place of peace & acceptance rather than judgement & opposition.

<b>Finally, when we practice empathy outwardly, we begin to practice it inwardly as well</b>. We begin to understand and respect ourselves as we are, not as we think we ought to be.

Be kind to others and yourself today!
