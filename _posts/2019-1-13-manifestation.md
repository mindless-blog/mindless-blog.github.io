# MANIFESTATION

<p id="quote">“All that we are is a result of what we have thought.”</p>

Regardless of your spiritual beliefs, exploring the thought of ***manifestation*** can be valuable. Manifestation can be described simply as the relationship between our thoughts and what happens to and around us.

An example: you may have noticed yourself being nervous about a presentation and consciously (and subconsciously) brought some self-doubt upon yourself. Unsurprisingly, that presentation probably did not go well! While these thoughts and the end result may seem unconnected, they are closely linked.

This is an example of manifestation - because you dedicated extensive thought to nervousness about your presentation and because you believed you were going to fail, the failure occurred. You manifested that event because you visualized it. Because of your own thoughts, your brain did not anticipate success and therefore did not act out!

**You might be thinking that this is a bit of a stretch - how can *thoughts* impact *actions* so directly?** However, there is evidence connecting the two - traits such as confidence and grit are often intertwined with success!

While you may not truly believe that you will succeed, you should work to visualize your success. Even if you did not study and are underprepared for an exam, negative thoughts will only lead to a higher chance of failure, whereas positive self-talk and manifestation could help you succeed.

By envisioning something, we also solidify our personal vision and goals. We are able to better understand what we actually value - what does my success look like a year from now? What do I want to be experiencing? This directs us to the things we care about most.

Whether you believe in this on an energetic or spiritual level it is up to you. Each individual’s understanding of manifestation might be different - I (Martin) am not a strong believer in energies and the spiritual nature of manifestation, but truly believe that it has scientific & logical validity.

Whatever your belief, the importance of positive self-talk, confidence, and visualization is undeniable in helping to bring you success. **It might not dramatically alter events, but will definitely alter your perspective of them.**

Manifestation can take many shapes, so we recommend doing whatever feels most natural to you. The following might be helpful:
* Visualize the situation in which you will succeed - what do you see, hear, feel, smell?
* Self-talk - “I will succeed. I will do this.”
* Aligned actions - if you want to be a great student, act like one! Adopting the habits of successful peers is one effective strategy.

**Whatever you do - believe in yourself.** 

Best,  
Martin & Ethan
