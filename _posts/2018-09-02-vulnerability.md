# VULNERABILITY

<p id="quote">“Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren’t always comfortable, but they’re never weakness!”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Brené Brown</p>   

Vulnerability is the birthplace of connection, belonging, and love. Being vulnerable means opening up to uncertainty by revealing a more intimate side of ourselves. Whether we’re sharing a well-kept secret with a friend, asking someone out, or saying “I love you” first, we have no guarantees of how the other person will respond. It’s for this reason that vulnerability takes courage. Most times, our attachment to the way others view us is what prevents us from taking this step.

We often shy away from being vulnerable because we’re scared that people won’t love us for who we really are. If we admit to someone else that we have issues with our family, social situation, or body image, we open ourselves to the judgement of others. Our fears create all sorts of hypotheticals to keep us closed off: “will they tell other people? What will they think of me if they see my shortcomings? <b>Will they still love me if I’m imperfect?</b>”

By refusing to let others in, we deny ourselves the chance to be loved as a whole: strengths & weaknesses included. <b>Being vulnerable is about letting go of who we think we should be and allowing ourselves to be who we really are</b>. And, it affirms to ourselves that despite our deepest flaws or fears, we don’t need a perfect persona to fool the world into validating us; <b>we are intrinsically and unconditionally worthy of love</b>.

Unfortunately, many of us have had experiences where others have taken advantage of us. In these cases, we may have adopted a fear of vulnerability. We should remember, however, that our fears keep us locked in the past if we let them control us. You do not need to be vulnerable with everyone you come across in order to experience deeper connection - simply choosing a close friend or loved one will show you its power.

We should also remind ourselves that numbing vulnerability and pain also numbs connection and love. Experiencing life and <i>all</i> of its emotions takes courage, but we all have it in us!

Additionally, becoming vulnerable calls for practice and intentional action. If you are fighting with a friend or loved one, instead of blaming them for an “annoying” behavior they have, or an arbitrary insult of their character, try to acknowledge how you’re truly feeling on the inside. 

Having the courage to say “I’m scared you don’t appreciate me anymore” is much more conducive to productive conversation and positive relationships. It is a step that takes courage, but a step necessary in building deeper bonds and healthier relationships.

<b>If we aren’t vulnerable with one another, we never truly get to know each other</b>. If we don’t acknowledge our perceived flaws or weaknesses, they stay hidden from the people we care about, and ourselves. Life is a journey best shared with others, and challenges, secrets, and fears are all a part of it. <b>Embracing the things that make us vulnerable is not a weakness, but a strength. It opens us to a deeper dimension of connection, love, & joy.</b>

Our issues with vulnerability often stem from the fear of judgement. Our next edition will focus on judgement as a whole and its role in living a more enlightened life.

Until next time,
