# YOU ARE NOT YOUR MIND

<p id="quote">“Let them come, let them be, let them go.”</p>

You have thoughts about your parents, about your job, about yourself, and just about everything that’s happening in your life. Sometimes, our thoughts can empower us to reach a goal we’ve been striving for. Other times, however, they can trap us in imagined negativity, such as worrying and anxiety. Will I make it to the bus on time? Is my boss going to be satisfied with my work? Am I smart enough to succeed in my classes?

These negative thoughts can consume us, and make us feel like we are bad people because we have bad thoughts. But it is important to realize that *you* are not your thoughts. If you were your thoughts, when one went, you would go too; and **yet here *you* remain**.

The key here is that you cannot *be* what you *perceive*. When you drive a car, you are simultaneously controlling and perceiving it. However, even though you almost fully control it, you never confuse *yourself* with the car. So then, if you are perceiving (and perhaps controlling) your thoughts, you cannot *be* them. Who, or what, are you then?

**Awareness**. The presence that perceives thoughts, or lack thereof. *You* are the sky, and your thoughts and emotions are passing clouds; some pleasant, others stormy.

So, why is any of this useful? Why ponder the idea of self when you have a life to live?

Everyone has bad days. Tapping into our deepest selves (our awareness) can help put our suffering in perspective. It reminds us that all our thoughts, emotions, and mental states are *temporary*, that no matter how bad we may feel right now, **no feeling is final**. Instead, stepping into our awareness opens a door to the present, allowing our thoughts & emotions to come and go fluidly. This perspective on life enables us to live in a state of non-resistance, **allowing us to work *with* life rather than against it.**

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your thoughts, try to interrupt the momentum by taking a few moments to sit in silence. It could be in your car, on a bench, or even in a bathroom. Close your eyes, and focus on the coming, and going of the breath.

Now, practice *observing* your thoughts instead of getting lost in them. Visualize yourself holding onto your thoughts as balloons, and letting them go. Or, maybe you’ll see them as clouds passing in your sky. The best way to exercise this muscle is to experiment and find what works for you! The underlying message can be your guiding principle: **your thoughts are just *happening*, and they have nothing to do with *you*.**

We are all human and having thoughts, both good and bad, is a part of the human condition. There is nothing wrong with having negative thoughts, insecurities, or limiting beliefs. Simply consider that raising your awareness of these negative thoughts can allow us to recognize them, and rise above them.

Until next week,
