# VALIDATION

<p id="quote">“Many men go fishing their whole lives without knowing it is not fish they are after.”</p>   
<p id="quote-author">- Henry David Thoreau</p>   



The human need for validation from others has been present since our beginnings - approval of others within the tribe was required for our physical safety. Even though social validation does not have the same purpose it used to, many of us fall into the illusion that it is a need that we have to fill. It isn’t! <b>You don’t need anything from anyone to let you know that you are perfect as you are!</b>

Reflecting on our relationship with social validation is all about asking ourselves <i>why</i>. Why am I choosing this career path, lifestyle, or relationship? Why do I feel the need to act a specific way (self-assured, dramatic, boastful, etc.) in different social environments? At the core of all these questions we can find another: Am I acting this way because I want others to respond in a specific way?

<b>Acting out of our perceived need for validation makes us victims to others’ inconsistent, irrelevant, fleeting judgments.</b> If we want to perform well at work or school because we want others to respect us, then we aren’t the ones controlling our lives. They are!

Our society, parents, and friends have an idea for what they want us to be (and we should listen to them and perhaps consider their opinions), but the ultimate responsibility of our thoughts and actions lies in our hands.

Over the course of this week, attempt to increase your awareness of the motivations behind what you’re doing. Maybe you’re attached to being validated by your circle of friends through humor or respect, or perhaps you act a certain way in front of one parent to feel loved. Take your realizations and keep them at the forefront of your mind as you continue to make decisions throughout your day.

Self-reflecting to this degree may sound daunting, but we should remind ourselves that this is where the inner-work lies. When we’re at our job or at school, we receive external confirmation validating our actions. When we do our inner-work, we may not receive a promotion or a letter grade, but that doesn’t make it any less essential to our well-being. <b>The reward will be a lifetime of contentment.</b>

When you feel yourself slipping into unproductive thought patterns, take a moment to pause and find a quiet space, even just for a couple moments. Affirm to yourself, silently or aloud, “I am enough. I have always been enough. I don’t <i>need</i> to be validated by (your realization about yourself), and my perceived need for this validation doesn’t dictate how I act. I am loved as I am, even if I may not feel it at this moment.”

Determining what is and isn’t fueled by validation is an undertaking that may feel endless. When we act out of our perceived need for validation, we might begin to criticize ourselves. However, this process isn’t about reaching absolute liberation from the need for validation, or being hard on ourselves when we don’t get there. <b>It’s about stepping into a greater awareness of yourself at every point in your journey.</b>

Meditation is a powerful practice that can enable us to heighten our awareness in this way. It also gives our minds repose from the incessant jumping between thoughts. Next Sunday, we’ll go into the basics of meditation and what it can do for you!

Until then,
