# MEDITATION

<p id="quote">“When you press the pause button on a machine, it stops. But when you press the pause button on human beings, they start.”</p>

Unfortunately, we spend many of our days thinking and worrying about the past or the future. <b>Meditation is an alternative through which we can open a door to the present, replacing our worry with peace and connecting with reality and ourselves on a deeper level.</b>

Many studies have shown improvements in clarity of mind, physical well-being, and relief from stress & anxiety among regular meditators, including top athletes and CEOs. This is a great reason to start meditating, but the best evidence you will ever get is the clear and positive change you will see in your life once you begin your practice.

It’s important that we begin by clearing up some misconceptions about meditation:

* You don’t need to be a mindful or spiritual person to hold a meditation practice. <b>Anyone can meditate!</b>
* Meditation is NOT about clearing your mind or not having thoughts.

So what is it, then?

<b>Meditation is about finding your center.</b> Finding your center means stepping into the now and being unaffected by the worries of the past & future. During our busy lives, our minds jump between thoughts incessantly - we rarely find time for silence, and even when we do, our minds try to fill that space with more thoughts. That’s the only way it’s been trained!

As we begin to meditate, our relationship with our minds and our thoughts also changes. We realize that our thoughts are just that - thoughts. They are not who we are, and do not have authority over our reality!

<b>In practical terms, meditation and mindfulness give us the ability to <i>respond</i> instead of <i>react</i> to what happens in our lives.</b> If we get cut off in traffic, instead of cursing and becoming annoyed, we’re able to let go of those negative emotions and continue with our lives. Letting go of unproductive emotions is a necessary part of becoming more mindful in our daily lives.


## GETTING STARTED

One of the easiest ways to begin your practice is through the use of guided meditations. These can be found on YouTube or on great phone apps like Calm. We have attached a great beginner guided meditation below. <b>We highly recommend you try it out today!</b> Feel free to also explore different and longer meditations!

For those of us who have had limited experience with meditation, the idea of beginning a regular practice may feel extremely daunting. Don’t worry! We’ll walk you through the basics.

* Sit in a comfortable position, with your hands on your knees or thighs and your back to a chair or wall.
* Put your headphones on, begin the guided meditation, and close your eyes as instructed.
* When you notice your attention has been swept up by a thought, don’t sweat it! Gently but firmly redirect it back to the instructions.
* Do not worry about what you will “get” out of the meditation. Having expectations for your first meditations goes against its very purpose! Just complete it, enjoy it, and you will begin to see results soon!
* Do not worry about having “too many thoughts”! <b>Being present to our thoughts rewires our brain to be more mindful even after meditation.</b>

Meditating a couple times may not have a clear impact on your life, but after 10 days of regular practice, we guarantee that you will notice positive changes. It will be easy to convince ourselves out of meditating on a given day- we might tell ourselves we’re too tired or busy. But we should remember that <b>just like physical exercise, regular maintenance and intentional practice is required to keep us sharp and mentally well.</b>

Through our practice, we get a peek at what it’s like to become fully immersed in the present moment. Next week we’ll talk about what it means to be in the Now.

Until then,  
Ethan & Martin
